### Description

Ez ASP Editor is an ongoing project of mine. I started it because i had no ASP editor... plenty of HTML editors out there, none of these. It is a text-editor with a Code Snippet Loader. View the ScreenShot to see. It just makes life easier for ASP programmers, the Snippet loader will let you load snippets from a directory, codes within this directory are normally "frequently used" codes, that you don't feel like retyping. it has a graphical toolbar with all handwritten functions in VB of course! No API
